To run the program on IX, you should make clean, make, and then run the start_servers.sh with some topology.




Answer the questions by selecting one of the given options. You may add additional information if you wish to.

- Does the server broadcast Joins correctly when a user requests a Join? Yes. In our implementation, we do not send joins
to servers from which we have already received a join on that channel, unless we get a leave from them or the timer
has expired (we have not received a join). We did this based off the guide provided: our output matches the guide exactly.
 
- Does the server broadcast Joins correctly when receiving a Join from another server? Yes. Our output matches the
guide H-topology exactly.

- Does the server generate unique identifiers correctly? Yes.

- Does the server renew Joins once per minute? Yes. We have optimized this process by only sending a join to an
adjacent server if we have not received a join from it in the past minute. This allows us to not send unnecessary joins.
For example, in the case of a triangle where each node is connected to the others (and all three have users so none are pruned),
 only two nodes will send joins as the third will hold back because it knows the other two are actively sending
joins and therefore still present. In addition, since servers with no users also have no channels, there is nothing to renew,
so it doesn't send a Join although it will forward one started by a server that has users.
  
- Does the server remove Joins older than two minutes? Yes.
 
- Does the server reply with a Leave message when it cannot forward a Say message? Yes.

- Does the server reply with a Leave message when it receives a duplicate Say message? Yes.

- Does the server avoid sending inappropriate Join, Leave, or Say messages? Yes.

- Does the server have all the functionality from program #1 when working in isolation? Yes.

- Does the client have all the functionality from program #1? Yes.
